    "This Python implementation analyzes triad motifs within a directed graph using the concept of connected 3-node subgraphs (triads). The code begins by loading a graph from an edgelist file and then identifies all connected triads. It computes a canonical representation for each triad to efficiently track and classify them. The code generates random graphs with the same degree distribution as the original graph to serve as a baseline for motif significance. The Z-score is then calculated for each triad by comparing its frequency in the real graph against the random graphs. Triads are classified as motifs (significantly over-represented), anti-motifs (significantly under-represented), or neutral. The results are visualized and saved in a CSV file for further analysis. The program is designed to handle large graphs by processing nodes in batches, ensuring memory efficiency."

    "The motif analysis reveals key structural patterns in the network, with highly represented motifs (Z-scores > 2.0) indicating crucial, stable interactions, like protein complexes or regulatory pathways in biological systems. Moderately represented motifs suggest important but less dominant structures, possibly reflecting intermediate roles in larger complexes. The anti-motif (Z-score = -4.66) highlights an under-represented configuration, potentially signaling unstable or unfavorable interactions, such as incompatible protein interactions. Neutral triads are neither over- nor under-represented, indicating redundant or non-essential connections. Overall, the analysis helps identify key functional modules, avoidable structures, and stable configurations critical for biological network functionality and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis identified 8 motifs and 1 anti-motif based on Z-scores derived from comparing the frequency of 3-node subgraphs (triads) in the original graph against random graphs with the same degree distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motifs: The motifs show significantly higher counts than expected in random graphs, with the most prominent motif having a Z-score of 63.88 (Motif 1), indicating a highly over-represented triad in the original graph. Other motifs also show strong significance, with Z-scores ranging from 3.04 to 63.88. These motifs might represent important structures or patterns in the graph that are significantly more common than in randomized networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anti-motif: There is 1 anti-motif (Z-score of -4.66), where the triad is significantly under-represented compared to random graphs, suggesting that this particular structure is rare in the original graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral Triads: Only 1 triad was found to be neutral, meaning its frequency in the original graph was similar to the random networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that the original graph contains certain structural patterns (motifs) that are much more frequent than in random networks, and one pattern (anti-motif) that is significantly under-represented. These findings can provide insights into the underlying structure or key relationships within the network.\n",
